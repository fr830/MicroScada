    There are three changes compared to the editor. We have to display water, and the state
    of the valves and pumps [+/-].
    
    [b]Intelligent network?[/b]
    
    Here, things are really tricky. We use a recursive path finding algorithm for the water
    movement. The technique is a bit complicated, so let just say that the simulation isn't
    perfect. With more time, we could measure the flow of water moving from one pipe to another,
    but we can't.
    
    That's because when the pump generates water, we search for the closest pipe which isn't
    filled yet, until the amount of fluid generated is depleted. Using this technique, water
    never moves from one pipe to another which is enough for the visual part. But we don't have
    the information necessary to implement a flowmeter for example. That's why we falled back
    to measuring the levels with gauges.
