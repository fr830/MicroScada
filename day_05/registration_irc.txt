[16:42] <kvuser0> Okay, so basically, I found out late about the contest, I still registered on the form. I had this project in mind for some time and it fits the education theme perfectly
[16:42] <kvuser0> I had setup my blog and my git repo, searching the techno or opportunity to det going
[16:43] <kvuser0> Found out about contest after it was started. Who can tell me if my application can be accepted
